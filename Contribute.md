## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by our Code of Conduct. Please be respectful, inclusive, and constructive in all interactions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Git
- A GitHub account

### First-Time Setup

1. **Fork the repository**
   - Visit the [archpkg-helper repository](https://github.com/AdmGenSameer/archpkg-helper)
   - Click the "Fork" button to create your own copy

2. **Clone your fork**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/archpkg-helper.git
   cd archpkg-helper
   ```

3. **Add upstream remote**
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/AdmGenSameer/archpkg-helper.git
   ```

4. **Verify your setup**
   ```bash
   git remote -v
   # Should show both origin (your fork) and upstream (original repo)
   ```

## Development Setup

### Environment Setup

We recommend using `pipx` for development to avoid conflicts with system packages:

1. **Install pipx** (if not already installed)
   ```bash
   # Arch Linux
   sudo pacman -S pipx
   pipx ensurepath

   # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt install pipx
   pipx ensurepath

   # Fedora
   sudo dnf install pipx
   pipx ensurepath
   ```

2. **Install in development mode**
   ```bash
   # For development with editable installation
   pipx install -e .
   
   # Or using pip in user mode
   python3 -m pip install --user -e .
   ```

3. **Install system dependencies**
   
   Depending on your distribution:
   
   **Arch Linux/Manjaro:**
   ```bash
   # pacman is pre-installed
   # Install AUR helper (optional but recommended for testing)
   sudo pacman -S yay
   # Install flatpak if needed
   sudo pacman -S flatpak
   ```
   
   **Ubuntu/Debian:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install flatpak
   ```
   
   **Fedora:**
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install flatpak
   ```

4. **Verify installation**
   ```bash
   archpkg --version
   archpkg --help
   ```

### Keeping Your Fork Updated

Regularly sync your fork with the upstream repository:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main
```

## Making Contributions

### Types of Contributions

We welcome various types of contributions:

- **Bug fixes** - Fix issues or unexpected behavior
- **Feature additions** - Add new functionality
- **Documentation** - Improve README, add examples, or API docs
- **Testing** - Add or improve test coverage
- **Performance** - Optimize existing functionality
- **Refactoring** - Improve code structure without changing functionality

### Before You Start

1. **Check existing issues** - Look for related issues or feature requests
2. **Create an issue** - For significant changes, create an issue first to discuss your approach
3. **Start small** - Consider starting with small contributions to get familiar with the codebase

### Branching Strategy

Create a new branch for each contribution:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```

**Branch naming conventions:**
- `feat/description` - New features
- `fix/description` - Bug fixes  
- `docs/description` - Documentation changes
- `refactor/description` - Code refactoring
- `test/description` - Test additions/improvements
- `chore/description` - Maintenance tasks

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

1. **Test your changes** - Ensure your code works as expected
2. **Update documentation** - Update README.md or relevant docs if needed
3. **Check code style** - Follow the coding standards (see below)
4. **Write meaningful commits** - Use clear, descriptive commit messages

### Commit Message Guidelines

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**
- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation only changes
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, semicolons, etc.)
- `refactor:` - Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
- `test:` - Adding or modifying tests
- `chore:` - Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

### Submitting Your Pull Request

1. **Push your branch**
   ```bash
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```

2. **Create Pull Request**
   - Go to your fork on GitHub
   - Click "New Pull Request"
   - Select your branch
   - Fill out the PR template with:
     - Clear description of changes
     - Link to related issues
     - Testing details
     - Screenshots (if applicable)

3. **Respond to feedback**
   - Address any review comments
   - Make additional commits as needed
   - Keep the conversation constructive

## Coding Standards

### Python Style

- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) Python style guide
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and small when possible

### Code Organization

- Place new package managers in appropriate modules
- Follow the existing project structure
- Import statements should be organized (standard library, third-party, local)

### Error Handling

- Use appropriate exception handling
- Provide clear error messages to users
- Log errors appropriately for debugging

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Install test dependencies
pip install -e .[test]

# Run tests
python -m pytest

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest --cov=archpkg
```

### Writing Tests

- Add tests for new features and bug fixes
- Use descriptive test names
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Place tests in the `tests/` directory

### Manual Testing

Test your changes across different scenarios:
- Different Linux distributions (if possible)
- Various package managers
- Edge cases (empty queries, network issues, etc.)

## Documentation

### Updating Documentation

- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Add docstrings to new functions and classes
- Update help text for new CLI options
- Consider adding examples for complex features

### Documentation Style
